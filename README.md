NOBBY

Nobby is a multi-function, self-launching glider display and control system. It automates essential glider operationsâ€”making flights easier, safer, and more efficient.

Features

Automated Cool-Down Timing: Tracks engine cool-down intervals for self-launching gliders.
eCompass (Digital Magnetometer): Real-time heading via LSM303AGR sensor.
Tailbeacon Controller: (Planned) Automates tailbeacon operation for safety/compliance.
Accelerometer: Monitors acceleration and orientation (via LSM303AGR).
Audio Input: (Planned) Integration with MAX 4466 for future acoustic/event sensing.

Hardware:
Microcontroller: ESP32 (M5Dial platform)
Magnetometer/Accelerometer: LSM303AGR
Microphone/Audio Sensor: MAX 4466
Display: Integrated with M5Dial

Project Status:
Core features (cool-down timer, eCompass) are implemented.
Tailbeacon control and advanced accelerometer/audio features are planned or in development.

Getting Started:

Build Requirements

PlatformIO or Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
Required libraries for M5Dial, LSM303AGR, and any display or sensor drivers
Wiring

LSM303AGR connected via I2C to ESP32
MAX 4466 connected to ESP32 analog input
Display is integrated on the M5Dial

Upload and Run:
Use PlatformIO or Arduino IDE to build and flash the firmware to your M5Dial device.
Usage

Power on the device; the display will show compass heading and cool-down timer.
Use the built-in interface to navigate additional features.
(Planned) Tailbeacon and audio features will be accessible as development progresses.
